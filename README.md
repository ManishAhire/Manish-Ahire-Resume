This app is a simple showcase of my work, built using **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and the **MVVM** architecture. It’s heavily inspired by [Themakew’s Resume App](https://github.com/Themakew/resume-app), but my goal was to rebuild the app entirely with SwiftUI.

## Features
✔️ **Tab View Navigation**: Easy-to-use tab view for smooth navigation between sections.  
✔️ **Dark & Light Mode Support**: The app adapts to the device’s appearance, switching between light and dark modes.  
✔️ **Contact Options**: You can call or email me directly through the app. I’ve also added a "Hire Me" button for easy connection.  
✔️ **Open PDF Files**: The app can open PDF files (like certificates) using the **PDFKit** framework.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Swift**: The main programming language used for the app.
- **SwiftUI**: A declarative framework for building the app’s UI.
- **PDFKit**: For displaying PDF files within the app.

## Architecture
The app is built using the **MVVM** architecture pattern, with elements of **Clean Architecture**. This separation of concerns makes the app more modular and easier to maintain, as the logic and the UI are well-separated.

## Challenges and Learning Experience

Since this is my first project with **SwiftUI**, I faced some challenges while learning the framework:

- **Learning Curve**: SwiftUI’s declarative syntax and reactive state management were new concepts for me, but I found them very powerful once I got used to them.
  
- **SwiftUI Concepts**: I explored various views like **Stack**, **TabView**, **ScrollView**, **Circle**, and **Rectangle**. I also worked with data flow using **@State**, **@Binding**, **@Published**, **@ObservedObject**, and **@Environment** properties to manage the app’s state effectively.


Overall, this project was a great opportunity to get hands-on with SwiftUI and learn its core concepts.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.
